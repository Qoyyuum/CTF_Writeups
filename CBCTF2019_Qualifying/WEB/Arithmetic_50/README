This was the only flag I got during the Qualifying round for 50 points.

Presented a webpage with a team name and arithmetic math problems and that there are 500 of them. Wrote a Python script to `request` the page, `regex` for the math problem that's wrapped in `<pre>` tags, appended the answer to the URL for the next page. Put all of that into a while loop and somehow, discovered that the flags are broken into 5 parts, each at 100 interval answer solved. I managed to get up to 400 and the flag obtained was: `CBCTF{500problemButMathA`

I crunched for time and decided to guess the remaining part with `intOne}`. We got lucky. The problem was with the last 100 questions was all in linear algebra. Example: `Z+25*43=1452510`. Stuck with some `SympifyError`. After the competition, someone mentioned about using Wolfram Alpha. I should have thought of using its API to solve this. Might give it a test later.
